Quick pattern you can use

When you see a weird extension, you can usually guess the source by the ecosystem:
	•	Microsoft Office world → .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, .rtf, .lnk, .dll
	•	Open standards / web → .html, .css, .svg, .json, .png
	•	Unix / Linux culture → .sh, .tar, .gz, .so (shared object library on Linux)
	•	Apple world → .dmg, .mov, .plist, .app

If you want, you can throw me a few extensions you’ve seen in the wild and I can tell you what app likely created them and whether they’re safe to open or likely malware bait.
